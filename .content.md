# How to use this module

```hcl
module "vault_dynamic_secret_mysql" {
  source  = "tf-vault-modules/dynamic-secrets-mysql/vault"
  version = "1.0.4"

  vault_mount_path = "database"
  db_username = "vault-user"
  db_password = "password"
  db_url = "mysql:3306"

  roles = [
    {
      role_name: "main"
      database_name: "wp-vault-test"
    },
    {
      role_name: "tf-modules"
      database_name: "wp-1"
    },
  ]
}
```

# Prerequisites

## Prepare dedicated MySQL user

There are no prerequisites or prerequisite actions for this module if we want to use *root* mysql user but I would strongly suggest to create dedicated user with elevated privileges that is capable of creating other users, which is the main purpose of this module.

To prepare mysql server for this module, execute following and feel free to modify and adjust privileges.

```sql
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'vault-admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'root';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'vault-admin'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

These commands will create a user that will be used in our Vault connection and it will be used for creation of other users based on the role. Of course, you will grant only certain privileges like CREATE AND GRANT but to test this module, this is enough.

## Docker containers

To test examples you need 2 containers running: Vault and MySQL. To start them use:

```shell
docker run -d -it --rm --cap-add IPC_LOCK --name=vault --net=host -e VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=root vault server -dev -log-level=debug
```

and MySQL

```shell
docker run -d --name mariadb --rm --env MARIADB_USER=vault-admin --env MARIADB_PASSWORD=root --env MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=root --net=host mariadb:latest
```

## Important Arguments

### Module arguments

**allowed_roles (Optional)** - Roles that can use this database connection. If you omit this argument, then list of roles will be generated from the *roles* list. Possible values are ["*"] or list of roles ["role-1", "role-2", "role-3", ...]. If omitted, value is empty list ([]) and list is generated from the *roles* list.

**lease_count_enabled** - Lease count quota; can be enable for Vault Enterprise only.

**default_creation_statements** - Module has integrated default creation statements, but this argument is for users who want to use different statements (also, there are: default_revocation_statements, default_renew_statements and default_rollback_statements). This will be applied to all defined roles

### Roles Arguments

**role_name**: Name of the role

**database_name** (Optional): Not Used

**creation_statements**: If you don't want to use default statements or if you need to specify statements ONLY FOR THIS role (ie. Role generates user that can access only one database, etc)
